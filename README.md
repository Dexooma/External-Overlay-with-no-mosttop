# External-Overlay-with-no-mosttop
This is a example how to create a game overlay that don't use "mosttop"

I tested it in Rust; Fortnite; RainbowSix
It is currently not detected by BE or EAC so far. I recommend to look at the setwindowpos and google a bit you will find a other way that is alot better.
